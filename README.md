The script is designed to selectively download WordPress sitemaps, particularly focusing on content-rich pages while ignoring auxiliary content. It's useful in several scenarios:

1. **Content Auditing**: Helps website owners or SEO specialists collect URLs of main content pages (posts, services, case studies) while filtering out less important URLs (attachments, tags, comments). This makes it easier to perform content audits or analysis.

2. **Site Migration**: When moving a WordPress site, this tool helps gather a comprehensive list of important URLs that need to be migrated or redirected, ensuring no critical content is lost in the process.

3. **SEO Analysis**: By downloading and parsing sitemaps of specific content types, it enables analysis of site structure, content organization, and URL patterns - all crucial for SEO optimization.

4. **Content Inventory**: Creates a filtered inventory of a WordPress site's content, focusing on meaningful pages rather than auxiliary content. This is particularly useful for large websites where manual URL collection would be impractical.
